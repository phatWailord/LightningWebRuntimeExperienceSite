                <p>I am a Salesforce full stack developer with over 7 years of experience working in SalesForce Orgs of all shapes and sizes. 
                    I started my development career designing basic applications for i-OS, then in college moved onto embedded systems development 
                    for extra-terrestrial applications, finishing with a senior thesis in processing signals received from a Frequency Modulated Carrier Wave (FMCW) RADAR using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs).

                <p>Upon graduating I started working on designing embedded control systems for large swarms of Unmanned Ariel Systems (UAS). When the project concluded, I moved onto sales engineering before
                    settling on SalesForce development. I have been designing end to end solutions using the platform ever since.
